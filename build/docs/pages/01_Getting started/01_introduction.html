    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
        Hubble is really easy to setup and even easier to use. Hubble is written in <code>SCSS</code> and vanilla <code>JavaScript</code>. It's dependency free and doesn't use <code>jQuery</code> at all. 
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a two different ways to use Hubble:
    </p>
    <p> 
        <strong>Basic Usage</strong><br>
        The most basic way would be to simply <a href="">download the latest build</a>, include <code>hubble.css</code> and <code>hubble.js</code> in your project.
    </p>

<pre class="highlight-wrap"><code class="js-highlight" data-syntax="html">
<!--
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="hubble.css">
</head>
<body>

    <script src="hubble.min.js"></script>
</body>
-->
</code></pre>

    <p>
        If you are wanting to use Hubble this way. You would simply include it in your project and build ontop of it with your own stylesheet and JavaScript. 
        If you intend to use Hubble this way, you can simply skip the <code>Getting started</code> part of this documentation and start familiarizing yourself with the Hubble's <code>CSS</code>.
    <p> 
        <strong>Recommended Usage</strong><br>
        The recommended way to use Hubble however is to build your project using <code>SCSS</code>, and integrate your own Hubble theme. You'll find out more information on how to do this correctly as you follow the documentation.

<div class="row" data-waypoint="reading-docs">
    <h2>How to read this documentation</h2>
    <p>
        If you are new to Hubble, I recommend you read this documentation from start to finish. If you are already familiar with Hubble, you can instead jump straight to the appropriate section.
    </p>
    <p>
        This documentation begins by explaining Hubble's concepts and architecture before venturing into specific topics like components, modules and sass mixins.
